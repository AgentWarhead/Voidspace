## What is Voidspace?

Voidspace is a **full-stack intelligence platform** for the NEAR ecosystem. It combines real-time market data, on-chain analytics, AI-powered development tools, and structured education into a single application — giving builders everything they need to discover opportunities, write smart contracts, and ship products on NEAR.

There is nothing else like it in the NEAR ecosystem. Or any ecosystem.

**462 source files. 108,879 lines of TypeScript. 456 commits. 3 weeks. Zero templates. One developer.**

---

## 🔭 Observatory — Ecosystem Intelligence Dashboard

The Observatory is a real-time command center for the entire NEAR ecosystem.

- **20+ browsable categories** — DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, Infrastructure, Social, DAOs, and more
- **140+ indexed NEAR projects** with live market data powered by DexScreener
- **Category-level aggregate stats** — total TVL, volume, token counts per vertical
- **Top Movers & New Pairs** — surface trending tokens and freshly listed pairs
- **DeFi Overview Banner** — ecosystem-wide liquidity, volume, and market cap at a glance

Every project page includes live token price, 24h volume, liquidity depth, GitHub activity, and links to all relevant resources.

---

## 🫧 Void Bubbles — 3D Market Visualization

An interactive **Three.js-powered bubble field** rendering the NEAR token ecosystem in real time.

- Bubble size = market cap · Color = 24h price change · Animation = volume
- **Whale alert system** — detects and highlights large transactions as they happen
- **9-stat ribbon** — price, volume, market cap, liquidity, gainers, losers, pairs, and more
- **Fullscreen mode** with glassmorphism UI overlay
- Click any bubble to deep-dive into that token's full profile

Not a chart. Not a table. A living, breathing visualization of the NEAR economy.

---

## 🔍 Void Lens — Deep Wallet Intelligence

Paste any NEAR wallet address. Get a **complete behavioral profile**.

- **6-axis reputation score** — Activity, DeFi engagement, Governance, Development, Security, Age
- **Portfolio valuation** — every token balance × live USD pricing via DexScreener
- **DeFi position tracking** — staking, LP positions, lending, yield farming
- **Security profiling** — suspicious patterns, contract interactions, risk signals
- **Transaction history** with categorization and behavioral radar chart
- **Address suggestions** — validates and autocompletes known NEAR addresses

Think of it as a credit score for blockchain wallets — but transparent and verifiable.

---

## 🌌 Constellation Map — Transaction Flow Graph

A **D3.js force-directed graph** that maps relationships between wallets visually.

- Enter any wallet → see every wallet it has transacted with, rendered as a network graph
- **Directional arrows** showing fund flow (who sent to whom)
- **Cluster detection** — highlights wallet groups that transact frequently
- **Time & value filters** — narrow transactions to specific date ranges and amounts
- **Interactive controls** — zoom, pan, search, minimap, context menus on every node
- **Edge hover tooltips** — see transaction count, total value, and date range per connection
- **Type filter pills** — toggle visibility by transaction type (transfer, stake, contract call)
- **Screenshot export** — one click to save your graph as an image
- **Fullscreen mode** for presentations and deep analysis

Reveals patterns invisible in raw blockchain data. Who funds whom. Where the money flows.

---

## 🔮 Voids — AI Opportunity Detection

Voidspace doesn't just show you what exists — it shows you **what's missing**.

- Analyzes real ecosystem data to detect **gaps** in the NEAR landscape
- Each "Void" is a scored opportunity (0–100) based on demand signals, competitive density, and technical difficulty
- **Void Brief** — click any opportunity to generate a full AI build plan: architecture, tech stack, go-to-market strategy, competitive analysis, and estimated timeline
- Powered by cross-referencing project data, market signals, GitHub activity, and category coverage

This is how you find what to build next.
