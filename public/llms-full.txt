# Voidspace — NEAR Ecosystem Intelligence (Full Reference)

> AI-powered ecosystem intelligence tool for the NEAR Protocol blockchain. Find market gaps ("voids"), explore the ecosystem, learn to build on NEAR, and discover opportunities.

## What is Voidspace?

Voidspace is a comprehensive intelligence platform for the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. It combines real-time data analysis, interactive visualizations, and a structured learning platform to help developers, founders, investors, and researchers understand and build on NEAR.

The name "Voidspace" refers to finding the "voids" — market gaps and underserved niches — in the blockchain ecosystem.
